## quick start
Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.
…or create a new repository on the command line

```
echo "# widgets" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/keeyanajones/widgets.git
git push -u origin master                
```

…or push an existing repository from the command line
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/keeyanajones/widgets.git
git push -u origin master
```

…or import code from another repository

You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
ProTip! Use the URL for this page when adding GitHub as a remote.
